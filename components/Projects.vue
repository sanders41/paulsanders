        - This package is an asyncronus Python client for the
        <a href="https://www.meilisearch.com/">MeiliSearch</a> search engine. In additon to
        creating this async client, I am also a contributor on the official
        <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-python">MeiliSearch Python</a>
        client, the
        <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-rust">MeiliSearch Rust</a>
        client, the
        <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation">MeiliSearch Documentation</a>,
        the <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/docs-scraper">MeiliSearch doc-scraper</a>,
        and the core <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch">MeiliSearch</a>
        project.

        <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/sas7bdat-converter">sas7bdat-converter</a>
        - This Python package converts proprietary sas7bdat and/or xport files from SAS into
        formats such as csv, json, and Excel useable by other programs. These conversion can be
        done on individual files, or on batches of files. Credit goes to
        <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/">Pandas</a> for performing the conversion
        of the sas7bdat and xport into DataFrames.

        <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/split-schedule">split-schedule</a>
        - My sister is a high school teacher, and when Covid-19 her school was trying to figure
        out a way to split their current schedule across multiple days in order to ruduce
        class size. They asked if I could help with this because they were having trouble
        figuring it out manually so I created this program. I released it as an open source
        project in hopes that it would be useful to other schools.
