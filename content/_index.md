  <h1>Hi, I'm Paul</h1>
  <p>
    I have over 20 years experience as a software engineer and data manager. In my free time I like
    working on Open Source software.

<p class="mt-4">
  I work as a consultant at PBS Data Solutions. Some of the services I provide are:

    <li>Data Management - specalizing in Animal Health Pharmaceuticals and Biologics</li>

  Some Open Source projects of mine are:
</h2>
<div class="mt-2">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/meilisearch-python-async">meilisearch-python-async</a>
      - This package is an asyncronus Python SDK for the
      <a href="https://www.meilisearch.com/">MeiliSearch</a> search engine. In additon to creating
      this async SDK, I am also a contributor on the official
      <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-python">MeiliSearch Python</a> SDK, along
      with multiple other MeiliSearch repositories.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/meilisearch-fastapi">meilisearch-fastapi</a>
      - This package provides pre-built routes for interacting with MeiliSearch that can be
      plugged into a larger FastAPI project.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/meilisearch-cli">meilisearch-cli</a>
      - This package is a command line interface for managing MeiliSearch
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/weather-command">weather-command</a>
      - I am interested in weather, spend a lot of time in the command line, and was looking for
      a reason to try out the <a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich</a> library.
      With that in mind I created this weather CLI.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/camel-converter">camel-converter</a>
      - In JSON keys are normally in camelCase format, while variable names in Python normally use
      snake_case. This package automatically converts between the two formats. In addition the
      package provides a <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">Pydantic</a> base model
      that, when inherited, allows Pydantic models to be created with the preferred Python style
      snake case variable names and will automatically convert from/to camel case when
      deserializing/serializing the data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/sas7bdat-converter">sas7bdat-converter</a>
      - This Python package converts proprietary sas7bdat and/or xport files from SAS into
      formats such as csv, json, and Excel useable by other programs. These conversion can be
      done on individual files, or on batches of files. Credit goes to
      <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/">Pandas</a> for performing the conversion
      of the sas7bdat and xport into DataFrames.
    </li>
