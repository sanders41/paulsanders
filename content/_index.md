  Some Open Source projects of mine are:
</h2>
<div class="mt-2">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/python-project-generator">Python Project Generator</a>
      - A CLI written in Rust to start new Python projects. It generates the boiler plate code
      needed when starting a new project. It automatically updates packages to their latest versions
      when creating the project, and has options to create pure Python projects, or Python project
      with Rust modules using PyO3.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/meilisearch-python-sdk">Meilisearch Python SDK</a>
      - This package is an Python SDK for the
      <a href="https://www.meilisearch.com/">Meilisearch</a> search engine that contains both an
      async client and a sync client. In additon to creating this SDK, I am also a maintainer on
      the official
      <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-python">Meilisearch Python</a> SDK, and
      contribute to multiple other Meilisearch repositories.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/camel-converter">Camel Converter</a>
      - In JSON keys are normally in camelCase format, while variable names in Python normally use
      snake_case. This package automatically converts between the two formats. In addition the
      package provides a <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">Pydantic</a> base model
      that, when inherited, allows Pydantic models to be created with the preferred Python style
      snake case variable names and will automatically convert from/to camel case when
      deserializing/serializing the data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/pytest-meilisearch">Pytest Meilisearch</a>
      - This is a package that provides a lot of the pytest boiler plate code and fixtures needed
      for testing Python projects that interact with Meilisearch.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/weather-command">Weather Command</a>
      - I am interested in weather, spend a lot of time in the command line, and was looking for
      a reason to try out the <a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich</a> library.
      With that in mind I created this weather CLI.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/sanders41/sas7bdat-converter">sas7bdat Converter</a>
      - This Python package converts proprietary sas7bdat and/or xport files from SAS into
      formats such as csv, json, and Excel useable by other programs. These conversion can be
      done on individual files, or on batches of files. Credit goes to
      <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/">Pandas</a> for performing the conversion
      of the sas7bdat and xport into DataFrames.
    </li>
  </ul>
